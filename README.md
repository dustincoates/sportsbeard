A selection of scripts that grabs player photos (and some additional data depending on league) from MLB, MLS, NFL, and NBA.

### Dependencies

- Node
- PhantomJS
- CasperJS

### Running the Scripts

To run all the scripts, run the following:

```bash
$ npm run scrape
```

### Remember

Remember, be considerate when running these scripts. Don't overload the sites with unnecessary traffic. The scripts were created to be one-offs, not regularly running items.

Also remember that because this is so heavily dependent on the DOM that these are liable to break at any time.
